### ShopIT!!

ShopIT is an ecommerce website for selling electronics and IT items aiming to serve the people on Internet.

#### Project Requirements
- the entire member screen data is controlled by an admin panel.
- Stripe Payment Integration for checking out.
- Product should be added to cart and the user can increase and decrease the Quantity.
- User should be able to register, login and logout being email address valid.
- Forgot password and Change password should be there.
- Every User has their own dashboard, which includes profile update and history of their ordered products.
- User should be able search the products.
- Pagination of products should be there.

#### Project Approach

- For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React. This involved creating the signin, register, navigation, header, main and footer components. 

- The next part was creating the backend of this project using Express js and involves creating an admin screen, registering the product's detail in the mongodb database and later the data is sent to the member screen.
- The challenging part of this web app was to integrate Stripe payment gateway integrations.
